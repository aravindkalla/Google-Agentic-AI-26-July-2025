# Drishti Vision Stream

A project leveraging Google's Agentic AI capabilities for vision stream processing.

## Description

This project appears to be a Python-based application for processing vision streams, possibly using Google Cloud AI and Vision APIs. The name "Drishti" is a Sanskrit word for "vision". The use of a service account key and a virtual environment suggests a cloud-integrated Python application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- A virtual environment tool (like `venv` or `virtualenv`)
- Access to Google Cloud Platform with necessary APIs enabled.

### Installation

1.  **Set up the environment:**

    This project uses a virtual environment. The `.gitignore` file indicates a directory named `.env_drishti`.

    Create and activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .env_drishti
    # On Windows
    .\.env_drishti\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source .env_drishti/bin/activate
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    A `requirements.txt` file is recommended. If one exists, run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    If not, you may need to install packages from the `site-packages` directory manually or generate a `requirements.txt` file.

### Configuration

1.  **Environment Variables:**
    The project seems to use a `.env_drishti` directory for its virtual environment. If there are environment variables to be set, they should be documented here. A common practice is to use a `.env` file.

2.  **Google Cloud Service Account:**
    The `.gitignore` file shows that `Drishti Vision Stream/service-account-key.json` is ignored. You will need to obtain your own service account key from the Google Cloud Console and place it in the appropriate directory.

    - Go to your Google Cloud project.
    - Navigate to "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts".
    - Create a service account with the necessary roles (e.g., Vision AI User).
    - Create a key for this service account and download the JSON file.
    - Place it at `Drishti Vision Stream/service-account-key.json`.

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to run the application.

```bash
python main.py # or similar
```
